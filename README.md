# CS361-Microservice
Description:
A microservice (in progress) that creates a list of all store items with their prices. It will read the files containing the items per store, along with their prices before converting it into a list (for each store) with the prices next to them. This allows a customer to view all a storeâ€™s items with their prices and compare them to another. List is converted to JSON, then sent back thru socket to the Python.   

How to Launch:
Download files and open the containing folder. In the terminal, type in these two steps to start the socket:
(1): python3 server.py
(2): python3 client.py
